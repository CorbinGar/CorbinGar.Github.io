            in the universe of the Alchemical archives there are several different races,ethnicities and cultures that exist within the canon however nothing exists in a vaccum,
            and creativity is just recyling and synthisizing old ideas into new ones,
            when it comes to races and ethnicities i would like to state that although certain cultures ethnicities and races may have been inspired by cultures in the real world i am in no means making any statments about 
            any real world cultures, i am just a fantasy writer and am not qualified to make statements on real world cultures and ethnicities
            all these cultures are only intened to exist in the books and DO NOT REPRESENT any real world equivilants
