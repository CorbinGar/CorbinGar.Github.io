        <h1>Bothabben "Botha"</h1>

        <p> Bothabben is an old god of Briar desceint and acheived immortality by Spreading their consiousness over a large neural network of trees, however if the network grows to large it becomes difficult
            to come to a concenus as well as the fact that thought speed delays means that the thoughtscape may change eratically over distance,unlike <a href="Jadyrnen.html" target="_Parent" ;>Jadyrnen </a> 
             Bothabben is capable of using Alachemy however in order to do such they can only use the percentage of the network that agree with 
        usage of alachemy and like <a href="Wrathyrnrizen.html" target="_Parent" ;>Wrathyrnrizen </a> it takes a long time to recover from the usage as well as need time for the KHI to cover the distance needed </P>

            <p> the last known case of Thyrn using alachemy was to deafeat the old god known as Xastratyl and has been recovering from that for thousands of years</P>
