        <h1>Xastratyl</h1>

        <p> Xastratyl is an old god of unknown desceint and acheived immortality by Gaining a large connection to the life, allowing them to prevent aging altogether and giving them an unlimited lifespan
            , however beacuase they have to be constantly using the life magic to prevent aging it means that they shed identity taint very slowly so the cannot use alachemy very often  </P>

            <p> The last known case of Thyrn using alachemy was to deafeat the old god known as Xastratyl and has been recovering from that for thousands of years</P>
