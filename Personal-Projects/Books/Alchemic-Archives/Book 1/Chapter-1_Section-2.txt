Erulia was not the prettiest of her siblings nor the smartest, but she did have something her sisters didn't, as she ran Maven grew close her two years of age making her taller and faster than her but 
just as she got close enough to lung for her diary Eurlia did IT she felt the warmth move from her chest to her legs making each step stronger, she surged ahead of her sister causing maven to stumble behind
"How?" Maven asked gasping for air with her hands on her knees

"You'll have to be quicker than that" Erulia taunted  waving mavens diary back and forth
"How do you always win" Maven asked again finally having caught her breath 
"Your just slow" erulia quiped lying down next to her sister
"No you did something" Maven accused
"no your just slow" erulia repeated
Maven looked at her squinting her eyes suspicously

"So you do fancy the mayors son" Erulia taunted
mavens eyes grew wide and her face turned a deeper shade of red
"Give me that" maven spat swiping the book from erulias hands
and inspecting it for any damage
"What does it feel like" Erulia asked

"Well" maven said thinking of a proper response
"Its when you admire someone and think they are the best thing in the world" maven said
"hmm" Erulia said thinking the reponse inadequate

"and you want to be around them and spend the rest of your life with them" maven said
"ah so i love you, not" Erulia said sticking her tongue out
"You little gremlin" Maven said laughingly

"So whats so great about him" Erulia asked
"hmm" Maven said thoughtfully
"Well he's nice for one" Maven responded
"Unlike a certain sister of mine" maven said poking Erulia in the side making her squirm 

"Hey stop that" Erulia shrieked rolling away from the attacker
"but we should probably head home soon" Maven said looking at her watch 
"But i dont want to" Erulia said sullenly
"Father doesn't let us play outside anymore" Erulia said getting up off the grass

"and thats beacuase its not safe" Maven said reproachfully standing up herself
"i wouldn't be out here if a certain someone hadn't stolen my diary" maven said looking at her little sister
"Father will probably be angry" Maven stated
"Why" erulia asked

"Beacuase were out here" Maven responded a thin line appearing on her neck
"no, why isn't it safe" Erulia asked
"Well thats beacuase some people don't like that the king rules" Maven responded blood coming out of her neck 
"But why isn't it safe for us" Erulia asked

"Beacuase were royalty" Maven responded her head falling off



Erulia jolted awake shivering in the cold rain
she used her arm to raise herself into a vertical position 
"that dream again" she thought using her arm to wipe cold water off her face
she pulled the scrap wet of cloth she called a blanket around herself
shivering again from the cold

"it looked like the weather was clearing up" she thought looking up into the dead grey sky 
"why should i care, its not like i'll be going anywhere" she thought looking at where her legs used to be

She heard steps from down the alley "was it them?"
"Here to finish what they started" she thought looking down the alley 
"At least i won't be cold anymore" she thought seeing a figure appear

a tall man with thick dark hair steped down the alley towards her
"Here it comes"

the man drew close examining her with cold blue eyes 
"Whats your name" he said

Erulia jolted in alarm expecting the man to shoot her and be done with it
she used her arm to shuffle away from the man not knowing what else to do against the assasin

"Whats your name" he repeated

she wedged herself in a corner moving a box between her and staring man 

he leaned down pushing the box aside looking her in the eyes 
"Would you like some food" he asked

she reached into the box and grabbed a hold of something
the man sighed 

"would you like s-" she cut him off smashing the bottle from the box on his head
He jolted back and started swearing 
after some time passed he looked back at her
"fine" he said turning and leaving

"he didn't kill me" she thought looking at the broken glass on the ground
it was an odd thought but she was so hungry that those came often
she again heard steps "was the man back for revenge" she thought
he came into the alley again this time carrying something

"hey no more bottles okay" he said
"that ones gonna leave a nasty bruise" he said more quitely
he thrust a hand forward containing some kind of wrapped food
"try it" he said

"this is an odd assassin" she thought curiously
"Poisin why? no one would care if she was shot in broad daylight"
but it smelled so good 
"well at least if you die of poisin you won't be cold anymore" she thought 
she grabbed the paper wrapped food an looked for signs of tampering, even though she wouldn't know how to spot if it had been tamped with

in a wreckless moment she took a bite throught the wrapper
"wait" he stuttered
his eyes fell to where her other arm should have been
"sorry" he said
