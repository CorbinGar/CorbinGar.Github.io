Heidren overlooked the vast charred feilds of the ashlands, barren and infertile, they turned their head to take in vast blackend horizon the sun set in the distance behind thick black clouds
its red glow reflecting in deadwater ponds that inhabited the small craters that pocked the landscape Heidren breathed in catching the fetid odor of burning flesh. they jolted out of their reverie, they had work to do
they turned to the feilds of twisted forms wrigling and writhing despite injuries that would kill any natural creature. Heidren flung his aura out, igniting it and lighting the nearest bodies aflame, they hoped the day would be over soon.
